# Telecom-Complaint-Classification
# Introduction
This project focuses on classifying customer complaints in a telecommunications company to enhance complaint management efficiency. By leveraging machine learning models, the project aims to predict complaint types based on various factors such as product category, customer type, and resolution details. The repository contains the code, data, and documentation used to perform the analysis.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes detailed records of customer complaints, categorized by features like:
- Complaint Type (Technical, Commercial)
- Product (Internet, Mobile)
- Customer Information (Type, Group)
- Dates (Open Date, Close Date)
- Status (Resolved, Escalated)
This dataset is a rich source for identifying patterns and making predictions about complaint outcomes.

# Project Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, irrelevant columns, and grouping related features.
- Modeling: Build machine learning models (KNN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes) to predict complaint types.
- Evaluation: Compare models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best performing model.

# Core Components
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize complaint trends and uncover insights related to complaint resolution times, product types, and escalation flags.
- Machine Learning: Develop, train, and evaluate multiple models to classify complaints effectively.
- Result Analysis: Provide a comparative analysis of the machine learning models to determine which is best suited for automating the complaint classification process.

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- Pandas, NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

# Documentation
The project includes:
- A detailed report outlining the data preprocessing steps, machine learning models used, and evaluation results.
- Python notebooks containing the code for data processing and model building.
- The Complaints Dataset.
